# VGKILL
VGKILL is a simple tool to nuke vanguard and restart it whenever you want, it also has integrated a task killer to automate the killing of some tasks, it can be run as admin with the -k option to autokill the tasks, making it easy to use as a automation tool.
An easy example is to put a shortcut to it on C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs and run it directly from the windows search bar.
Also, i almost forgot, put the programs you want to kill in the tokill.txt file, it recognizes wildcard (*) to autocomplete the program name.
